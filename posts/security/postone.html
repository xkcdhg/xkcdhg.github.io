            <h1>An Influence Network Model</h1>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Mengbin Ye, along with other researchers, authored a paper titled "An Influence Network Model to Study 
Discrepancies in Expressed and Private Opinions." The paper aims to introduce an agent-based model capable of, 
replicating the outcomes of Solomon Asch's experiments conducted in 1951, and demonstrating the impact of 
societal pressures on individuals within a network, by tracking the temporal evolution of an individual's private 
and expressed beliefs on a particular subject. The proposed model is subjected to testing using both the scenarios 
from Asch's experiments and additional scenarios devised by the author of this paper. Discrepancies between the 
results obtained by Ye and those presented in the current paper are apparent, particularly regarding the 'threshold 
model,' which was neither analyzed nor clearly well-defined in Ye's original work. </p>
                <p>In numerous social situations, a discrepancy often emerges between an individual's private beliefs and the 
opinions they publicly express on a particular topic. Building upon the research and the experiment of Solomon 
Asch and other socio-psychological studies, the author of the paper introduces a pioneering model for 
understanding how such disparities manifest within broader social networks of interpersonal influence. Within 
this model, each member of the network holds both a private opinion and an expressed one: the former evolves 
through social interactions influenced by the expressed opinions of their neighbors, while the latter is shaped by 
pressure to conform to the collective expressed opinion of those nearby, termed the "local public opinion." 
The author aimed to develop a novel opinion dynamics model, serving as a comprehensive theoretical framework 
for investigating the emergence of disparities between individuals' private beliefs and their publicly expressed 
opinions. This model sought to explore how various individual characteristics influence the evolution of opinions, 
thereby bridging the gap between socio-psychological research on conformity and dynamic models of 
interpersonal influence. </p>
                <p>The author establishes general network conditions that ensure rapid convergence of opinions to a stable state. 
Further examination of this stable state leads to several semi-quantitative insights with profound social 
implications, including the identification of conditions under which every individual in the network experiences 
such a discrepancy. Lastly, we demonstrate the model's broad applicability and predictive power by employing it 
to explain and anticipate the outcomes of Solomon Asch's seminal experiments. Other variations of the conditions 
are presented, leading to simulations that were not presented in the author’s paper.</p>
                <p>Significant disparities between the private beliefs and publicly expressed opinions within a population can lead 
to discontent and tension, factors notably associated with historical events like the Arab Spring movement and 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. These discrepancies also give rise to phenomena such as pluralistic ignorance, 
wherein individuals privately reject a certain viewpoint but incorrectly perceive the majority as accepting it. 
Additionally, concepts like the "spiral of silence" and the enforcement of unpopular social norms are linked to 
such disparities. The "spiral of silence" is a social phenomenon where individuals are less likely to voice their 
opinions or beliefs if they perceive them to be in the minority within a particular social group or society as a 
whole [1]. This reluctance to speak out arises from a fear of social isolation, rejection, or reprisal for holding 
unpopular views.</p>
                <p>There are numerous reasons why individuals might refrain from expressing their private opinions, including 
concerns about political correctness, especially in discussions about sensitive topics. For instance, preference 
falsification occurs when individuals distort their true views due to social pressures, whether this pressure is real 
or perceived. This phenomenon is evident in scenarios like politicians altering their stances to appeal to voters. 
Pressures to conform can stem from various sources, including unspoken traditions and the fear of standing out. 
Additionally, individuals may conform to group norms driven by incentives such as monetary rewards, status, or 
other forms of recognition.</p>
