            <h1>An Influence Network Model</h1>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Mengbin Ye, along with other researchers, authored a paper titled "An Influence Network Model to Study 
Discrepancies in Expressed and Private Opinions." The paper aims to introduce an agent-based model capable of, 
replicating the outcomes of Solomon Asch's experiments conducted in 1951, and demonstrating the impact of 
societal pressures on individuals within a network, by tracking the temporal evolution of an individual's private 
and expressed beliefs on a particular subject. The proposed model is subjected to testing using both the scenarios 
from Asch's experiments and additional scenarios devised by the author of this paper. Discrepancies between the 
results obtained by Ye and those presented in the current paper are apparent, particularly regarding the 'threshold 
model,' which was neither analyzed nor clearly well-defined in Ye's original work. </p>
                <p>In numerous social situations, a discrepancy often emerges between an individual's private beliefs and the 
opinions they publicly express on a particular topic. Building upon the research and the experiment of Solomon 
Asch and other socio-psychological studies, the author of the paper introduces a pioneering model for 
understanding how such disparities manifest within broader social networks of interpersonal influence. Within 
this model, each member of the network holds both a private opinion and an expressed one: the former evolves 
through social interactions influenced by the expressed opinions of their neighbors, while the latter is shaped by 
pressure to conform to the collective expressed opinion of those nearby, termed the "local public opinion." 
The author aimed to develop a novel opinion dynamics model, serving as a comprehensive theoretical framework 
for investigating the emergence of disparities between individuals' private beliefs and their publicly expressed 
opinions. This model sought to explore how various individual characteristics influence the evolution of opinions, 
thereby bridging the gap between socio-psychological research on conformity and dynamic models of 
interpersonal influence. </p>
                <p>The author establishes general network conditions that ensure rapid convergence of opinions to a stable state. 
Further examination of this stable state leads to several semi-quantitative insights with profound social 
implications, including the identification of conditions under which every individual in the network experiences 
such a discrepancy. Lastly, we demonstrate the model's broad applicability and predictive power by employing it 
to explain and anticipate the outcomes of Solomon Asch's seminal experiments. Other variations of the conditions 
are presented, leading to simulations that were not presented in the author’s paper.</p>
                <p>Significant disparities between the private beliefs and publicly expressed opinions within a population can lead 
to discontent and tension, factors notably associated with historical events like the Arab Spring movement and 
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. These discrepancies also give rise to phenomena such as pluralistic ignorance, 
wherein individuals privately reject a certain viewpoint but incorrectly perceive the majority as accepting it. 
Additionally, concepts like the "spiral of silence" and the enforcement of unpopular social norms are linked to 
such disparities. The "spiral of silence" is a social phenomenon where individuals are less likely to voice their 
opinions or beliefs if they perceive them to be in the minority within a particular social group or society as a 
whole [1]. This reluctance to speak out arises from a fear of social isolation, rejection, or reprisal for holding 
unpopular views.</p>
                <p>There are numerous reasons why individuals might refrain from expressing their private opinions, including 
concerns about political correctness, especially in discussions about sensitive topics. For instance, preference 
falsification occurs when individuals distort their true views due to social pressures, whether this pressure is real 
or perceived. This phenomenon is evident in scenarios like politicians altering their stances to appeal to voters. 
Pressures to conform can stem from various sources, including unspoken traditions and the fear of standing out. 
Additionally, individuals may conform to group norms driven by incentives such as monetary rewards, status, or 
other forms of recognition.</p>
<p>In essence, the experiments delved into how individuals respond when 
confronted with "two contradictory and irreconcilable forces": (i) an 
unequivocal and indisputable fact, and (ii) a unanimous majority of peers 
who take positions contrary to this fact. Within the experiment, eight 
participants were tasked with assessing a series of line lengths. Among 
these eight individuals, one served as the primary subject, while the 
remaining seven acted as "confederates" who were informed beforehand 
about the predetermined responses they were to provide.</p>
<p>Three lines of varying lengths are presented, and the group 
engages in open discussions to determine which of the lines, 
labeled A, B, or C, matches the length of a designated line. Each 
participant must independently announce their choice, while the 
confederates unanimously endorse the same incorrect option, such 
as B. The subject of the experiment is the last to declare his or her 
opinion, enabling him or her to listen to all the other participants 
answers before deciding themselves [2]. Answers of the 
participant under test are then documented, followed by a post
experiment interview to get the participant's private belief. </p>
<p>Asch documented three distinct response patterns among participants faced with the dilemma of either affirming 
an incontrovertible truth or aligning with a unanimous majority that contests its correctness. Asch also identified 
several factors that influenced participants’ tendencies to conform to the incorrect judgements of their peers [3]. 
Some of these factors are group size, group pressure, concern for being liked... etc, Figure 1 [3]. Simulations 
showing the effect of the first factor are provided at the end of the paper, fig.12.</p>
<p>The author proposed the Expressed-Private-Opinion (EPO) model, where each individual (agent) has both a 
private and an expressed opinion. Inspired by the Friedkin–Johnsen model, we propose that an individual’s private 
opinion evolves under social influence exerted by the individual’s network neighbors’ expressed opinions, and 
each individual remains attached to their initial opinion with a level of stubbornness. Then the author proposes 
that each individual has some resilience to this pressure, and each individual expresses an opinion altered from 
their private opinion to be closer to the local average expressed opinion.  
We identify the following parameters: 
i. 
Stubbornness 
ii. 
iii. 
Resilience 
Connectivity of the network 
The combination of the preceding parameters generically leads to every individual having a discrepancy between 
their final expressed and private opinions. In our model, an individual falsifies his or her opinion due to pressure 
to conform to the group average opinion.  
We identify stubbornness and resilience parameter ranges for all 3 responses; this capturing of all 3 responses is 
a first among ABMs. </p>
