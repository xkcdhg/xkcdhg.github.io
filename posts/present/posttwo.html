                <p>A girl decides to become vegetarian and slowly starts slipping into madness. Years of waking up and insisting on taking the same choices of yesterday. Until she rids herself of one thing, meat. Then another, food. And eventually, her own self. She becomes one with the trees. Standing upside down trying to grow in reverse, deep into the soil. She sat naked in the sun, while eyes stared. She felt alive getting painted. Only with colorful flowers. She had a birthmark. Was she special? Whatever she was, she was not anymore. 
But what is the point of such life? What is the point of destroying such life? We would not be seeking a point if such lives were not so harshly and ironically destroyed. These lives go on suffering in the darkness of stale apartments. Long lives. We only ask for meaning when all possible answers are gone. An ordinary life with zero change, that adds one extra life, is rarely ever put to the question of what purpose it serves. For as long as you have birthed, you have planted the seed of purpose. You have the chance of ever causing the change. The vegetarian had no children. Was she a specialized soul? Sent to serve a local purpose. 
What is the point of a life of a severely mentally defected person? What is the point of making something so out of control, and inserting it into settings that demand self-control.
